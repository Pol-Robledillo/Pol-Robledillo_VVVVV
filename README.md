# Pol Robledillo_VVVVV
## **Game Info**
This game is my version of the video game *VVVVVV*. This platformer game’s main mechanic is that instead of jumping, you change the character's gravity to beat different levels.

## **Instructions**
Go into the build folder to play the game or check the unity project by going into the VVVVV folder.

## **Controls**
- `W` / `D` or `<--` / `-->` to move the character
- `Spacebar` to change gravity
- `Escape` to pause the game
